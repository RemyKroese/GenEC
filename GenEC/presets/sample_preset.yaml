# Preset file sample for quicker tool execution

# a Parent preset can be filled in, in case several different presets with overlapping answers are desired
# A preset can be partially filled in, then unanswers values will be asked by the tool on execution
# for "should_slice_clusters":
# - when the value is false, this question will not be asked
# - when the value is true, the cluster filter questiosn will be asked if left unanswered
#   this could be useful when for example wanting to filter on timestamps, which differ per file

# This preset file can be used by executiong the tool with the parameter "--preset sample_preset"
# since no file is specified, the tool will then ask which preset should be used:
# 1. main_preset
# 2. sub_preset_A
# 3. sub_preset_B

# A preset can also be specified directly, by by executiong the tool with the parameter "--preset <preset_file_name/<preset_name>"

# This preset can be used by executiong the tool with the parameter "--preset sample_preset/main_preset"
